Problem Statement



Dinesh is developing a geometry calculator program for a Math class. He wants to write a program that allows users to calculate the area of different geometric shapes, such as circles, rectangles, and triangles.



Users can select the type of shape they want to calculate the area for, and the program will perform the corresponding calculation using a 'switch-case' statement.



Formulas Used:

Area of Circle = 3.14 * radius * radius

Area of Rectangle = length * width

Area of Triangle = 0.5 * base * height

Input format :
The first line of input consists of an integer, representing the geometric shape the user wants to calculate the area for (1 for a circle, 2 for a rectangle, and 3 for a triangle).

If the choice is 1, the second line of input consists of a double value R, representing the radius of the circle.
If the choice is 2, the second line and third lines of input consist of double values L and B, representing the length and width of the rectangle.
If the choice is 3, the second and third lines of input consist of double values P and Q representing the base and height of the triangle.
Output format :
If the valid choice is entered, the output prints "X sq.units" where X represents the calculated area of the specific shape, rounded off to two decimal places.

Otherwise, the output prints "Invalid choice"



Refer to the sample output for the formatting specifications.

Code constraints :
The given test cases fall under the following constraints:

1.0 ≤ R, L, B, P, Q ≤ 100.0
